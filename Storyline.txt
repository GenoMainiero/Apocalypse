The theme for our adventure game is post-apocolypse. 

The game opens by telling the user that they are in a large city following a series of natural disasters.
They are believed to be the last living person in the city.
There is reason to believe that people in other cities may have survived.

The user starts out in the middle of the destroyed city.
A nearby radio tower *may* be used to communicate to survivors in other cities (if there are any).
The objective of the game will be to find the radio tower, although the user will also need to find food and water.
Some challenges include avoiding chemical spills from a power plant and electrified flood water.
