Military base- The user can explore this area. A description should appear stating that this is clearly the site of a large explosion.
The uese wonders of the cause of the apocalypse could be a result of a military project gone wrong.

Update 10/26
Additional blocks:
-Rubble
-Sinkhole

Additional Rooms:
-Street: allows access to other useful rooms
-Clothing Store- If the user gets here before the radioactive wave, they find a jacket that they are able to take (which will lessen
the effects of the wave). If after the wave, they can still take the jacket but get a sarcastic message about how the jacket would've been nice before.
-Hospital- If the user is not at the safehouse by the time of the radioactive wave, but was wearing the jacket, they will survive the wave
 but need to get to the hospital to find an antibiotic for their burns. 
-Supermarket- The user can find water and bread.
-Radio Place- The user finds a battery to fix the radio in the radio tower (note: update radio to need battery).
-Hardware Store- The electrical gloves and tape should now be located here instead of in the radio tower. The user will
need to find the gloves and tape beofre activating the radio.  
-Airport- The user needs to get here to be picked up by the airplane and rescued 
 
*General storyline update: After fixing the radio, the user will now communicate with survivors who tell the user
to get to an airplane pick up. The user will need to find the airport and will eventually be picked up.

Update 10/22
Changes to the blocks:

Chemical Spill: You see that chemicals are spilling from a nearby power plant. You suspect that attempting to walk
through the chemicals may be unsafe, maybe even fatal. Do you wish to continue
-if Yes: You continue on safely for several minutes without a problem. You are beginning to think that the chemicals
are not harmful when suddenly you feel a burning sensation in your legs. The burning quickly spreads thoughout
your body and you become immobilized. You will not be making it out of the apocalypse. 

Burning Buildings: You see several burning buildings. You suspect that maybe one of the buildings has supplies. However, 
climing into a burning building will likely prove fatal. Would you like to continue?
-if Yes: You run into the burning building, attempting to stay close to the ground to avoid inhaling smoke. Shortly
after you enter the building the celing collapses onto you. You did not survive the apocalypse.

Update 10/12:

(Based on Jose's map available in discord)

The user is standing in the street facing the radio tower. 

If the user tries to go to the opposite direction they are facing, they are blocked by flood water that may be electrified.

If the user tries to go to the right, they would be moving too close to a chemical spill at a nearby power plant
(This is different from what is on the map bc we are trying to have only 2 locations for now).

If the user goes to the left, they will see several burning buildings, but one building that is in good condition.
This is the safe house. Once inside:
-Right: The user finds a flashlight that may be useful later
-Left: The user finds bread. They may either eat or store this bread in their backpack.
-Forward: The user finds a large bottle of water. They may either drink or store the bottle.

If the user walks straight, they will arrive at the radio tower building. It is too dark to see anything.
-If they did not pick up the flashlight before they should be prompted to go back and look for it.
-If they already picked up the flashlight they should turn it on.
-Once inside:
   -Right: The user finds electrical gloves. They will need to put on the glove.
   -Left: The user finds electrical tape.
   -Forward: The user sees the radio. Clearly one of the wires is damaged which they will need to repair with tape.
             The machine is clearly damaged so the user will use electrical insulating gloves.
             If the user has gloves and tape then they are able to fix the radio and contact people from another city.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The theme for our adventure game is post-apocolypse. 

The game opens by telling the user that they are in a large city following a series of natural disasters.
They are believed to be the last living person in the city.
There is reason to believe that people in other cities may have survived.

The user starts out in the middle of the destroyed city.
A nearby radio tower *may* be used to communicate to survivors in other cities (if there are any).
The objective of the game will be to find the radio tower, although the user will also need to find food and water.
Some challenges include avoiding chemical spills from a power plant and electrified flood water. 

Objects that the user has to begin:
backpack
liter of water

Objects that the user may find:
Crowbar
Electrical insulating gloves
Flashlight
Electrical tape
Well with water
Food in old grocery store
