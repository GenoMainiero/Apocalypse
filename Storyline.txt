The theme for our adventure game is post-apocolypse. 

The game opens by telling the user that they are in a large city following a series of natural disasters.
They are believed to be the last living person in the city.
There is reason to believe that people in other cities may have survived.

The user starts out in the middle of the destroyed city.
A nearby radio tower *may* be used to communicate to survivors in other cities (if there are any).
The objective of the game will be to find the radio tower, although the user will also need to find food and water.
Some challenges include avoiding chemical spills from a power plant and electrified flood water. 

Objects that the user has to begin:
backpack
liter of water

Objects that the user may find:
Crowbar
Electrical insulating gloves
Flashlight
Electrical tape
Well with water
Food in old grocery store

Update 10/12:

(Based on Jose's map available in discord)

The user is standing in the street facing the radio tower. 

If the user tries to go to the opposite direction they are facing, they are blocked by flood water that may be electrified.

If the user tries to go to the right, they would be moving too close to a chemical spill at a nearby power plant
(This is different from what is on the map bc we are trying to have only 2 locations for now).

If the user goes to the left, they will see several burning buildings, but one building that is in good condition.
This is the safe house. Once inside:
-Right: The user finds a flashlight that may be useful later
-Left: The user finds bread. They may either eat or store this bread in their backpack.
-Forward: The user finds a large bottle of water. They may either drink or store the bottle.

If the user walks straight, they will arrive at the radio tower building. It is too dark to see anything.
-If they did not pick up the flashlight before they should be prompted to go back and look for it.
-If they already picked up the flashlight they should turn it on.
-Once inside:
   -Right: The user finds electrical gloves. They will need to put on the glove.
   -Left: The user finds electrical tape.
   -Forward: The user sees the radio. Clearly one of the wires is damaged which they will need to repair with tape.
             The machine is clearly damaged so the user will use electrical insulating gloves.
             If the user has gloves and tape then they are able to fix the radio and contact people from another city.
